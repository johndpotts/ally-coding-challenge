# Ally Coding Challenge

### Summary
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this challenge; I look forward to hearing your feedback.
The styling for this page was produced in SASS; I used gulp locally to preview the site and compile the CSS.

### Review of the challenge
The challenge was to create a site used on the given comps. The site was to be responsive, accessable, and created without any frameworks like Bootstrap.

### Possible areas for improvement
 - Without specified hex codes and fonts I came reasonably close using online tools. Actual specs would have been preferable.
 - The method I used to produce the correct table headers was a little hackish; it would be an area of concern if elements of the 
 JSON file were to change. I would be interested in working on alternative methods were this a production site with the potential for data input to change.
 - While the site is responsive, if this were a production site I would be interested in tweaking some of the mobile layout design; in particular changing the initial landing area with an image or design to make it look nicer and re-formatting some of the items like the tabbed news/archive area. That seemed beyond the scope of what I was asked to do, though.
 

#### In closing
Thank you again for reviewing my work; I look forward to hearing any feedback and/or tips for improvement you might have.
Please feel free to explore my other projects on Github; I'm always working on something interesting!
